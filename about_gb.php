         <h2>MISSION/VISION</h2>
		 <h4>Our Vision</h4> 
            <p>Through education, empowerment, and the unification of our diverse urban and rural communities, our vision is to transform lives, create a sustainable economy, and promote equal access to local, organic food for all.</p>

            <h4>Our Mission</h4> 
            <p>Groundbreakers empowers economically-disadvantaged men and women through vocational training in sustainable, organic food production. Our hands-on education program provides an opportunity for personal growth, economic stability, and reintegration with the community at large. 
            <br /><br />Groundbreakers also supports the local farming community by offering an opportunity to donate land, resources, and work hours to a sustainable, community-based project that ultimately increases skilled local employment. Finally, through key food distribution partnerships, Groundbreakers helps economically-disadvantaged men and women gain consistent access to healthy, locally-grown produce.

            <h4>Our Values</h4>
            <p>Compassion, Community, Growth, Dignity, Respect, Opportunity, Hope</p>
