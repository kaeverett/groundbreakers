			<h2>ABOUT FARM</h2>
            <h4>The Farm</h4> 
            <p>Groundbreakers welcomes all men, women and youth, regardless of ideology, 
            religion, and social background, at their abundant 2 acre community farm.
            Located in the Snoqualmie Valley, focus is placed on small-scale, biodynamic 
            agriculture practices that emphasize organic and ecologically-conscious farming 
            and the importance of local food systems.  The heart of the farm operation includes 
            access to 6 propagation houses, watering equipment, tools, seeds, and some of the 
            richest soil in the state. It also provides an ideal space for hands-on activities, 
            large scale demonstration projects, and for growing a variety of plants, vegetables and 
            herbs.
			Farm operations are primarily supported through private and corporate donors, 
            and grant opportunities.  A small portion of funding is received through the sale of organic produce.</p>

            <h4>Community Garden</h4> 
            <p>The Community Garden has twenty 12'x12' plots available for use by students and volunteers for free.  
            Groundbreakers will provide organic certified seed, irrigation and tools. In exchange, Groundbreakers 
            asks that the owner of each plot volunteer and maintain responsibility for weeding and harvesting food 
            for 2 of our farm beds (approximately 900 sq. ft.). </p><p>Land availability may be limited.  
            Donations are welcomed and help to cover operating costs (i.e. purchasing seeds, tools, and gardening 
            literature) for the Community Garden.</p>
