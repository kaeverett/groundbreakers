Our goal is to support all of our students to successfully obtain employment before they graduate. The employment component of the Vocational Farming Program begins with students examining their career goals, interests, and skills. This progresses to employment skills, when students learn how to fill out applications, write resumes and cover letters, interview successfully, and search for and apply to jobs on the Internet. A more detailed breakdown is as follows:

		<br/>* A Job vs. a Career
		<br/>* Skills Inventory
		<br/>* Employment Hurdles/Goal Setting
		<br/>* Work and Skills History
		<br/>* Using Email 
		<br/>* Applications
		<br/>* Job Research on the Internet 
		<br/>* Resumes
		<br/>* Online Applications 
		<br/>* Mock Interviews
		<br/>* Punctuality, Positive Work EthicandProfessional Behavior
		<br/>* Mock Interview Sessions / Informational Interviews
		<br/>* Job Search

			Graduate Support:
			Graduates are contacted monthly for one year following their graduation and receive support in the form of job advice, employment search assistance, and help with a variety of other social service resources.
