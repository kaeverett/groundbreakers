			<br/>
			<h5>Internships – 100 Hours per Student</h5>
			<p>Students participate in two independent internships where they can experience working in various farming or gardening environments, which may include greenhouse stations, landscaping projects, community supported agriculture operations, packaging, and more.</p>
			<br/>
			<h5>Personal Life Sessions</h5> 
			<h5>30 minutes weekly (8 hrs/class cycle)</h5>
			<p>Students meet individually with our staff and volunteers on a weekly basis to identify and discuss personal and professional goals. These sessions also include scheduling appointments for services such as rental assistance, mental health and dental health appointments, affordable housing, child care and energy assistance. Students also discuss program progress during these sessions.</p>

			<br/>
			<h5>Employment Skills and Job Search: 2 Weeks (80 hours)</h5>
			<p>
				The last two weeks of the program consist of a full-time job search, when students spend each day filling out applications and going on interviews. Our goal is to support all of our students to successfully obtain employment before they graduate. The employment component of the Vocational Farming Program begins with students examining their career goals, interests, and skills. This progresses to employment skills, when students learn how to fill out applications, write resumes and cover letters, interview successfully, and search for and apply to jobs on the Internet. A more detailed breakdown is as follows:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><ul>
					<li>A Job vs. a Career</li>
					<li>Skills Inventory</li>
					<li>Employment Hurdles/Goal Setting</li>
					<li>Work and Skills History</li>
					<li>Using Email</li>
					<li>Applications</li>

				</ul></ul>
